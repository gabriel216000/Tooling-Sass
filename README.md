# Tooling-Sass

# There are 4 files of scss code, main.scss ( the main file for the project ) and 3 partials ( _functions.scss, _variables.scss, _mixins.scss )

# I try to shed light on the most useful aspects of Scss.

# I found imports, variables, mixins, loops and functions to be the most useful things that you can use.
